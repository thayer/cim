          <p><strong><a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/scott-davis/">Scott Davis</a></strong></p>
          <p>A Dartmouth engineering PhD graduate, Professor Davis has developed his own NIH-funded research program at Dartmouth, examining molecular sensing tools for pre-clinical tissue imaging, assessing drug efficacy in vivo and as a surgical guidance tool. He has been involved in clinical trial work in the US as well as the UK, and maintains the nirfast.org project as an open source set of software tools.</p>
          <p><strong><a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/jonathan-elliott/">Jonathan Elliott</a></strong></p>
          <p>Trained in perfusion and flow imaging systems, Professor Elliott was awarded a prestigious NIH K99 grant to start his own research program at Dartmouth, developing surgical fluorescence imaging tools to assess flow in tumors and molecular binding in different pathologies. He has been involved in both pre-clinical and clinical trials assessing contrast in brain tumors and assessing the metabolic and immunologic ways in which contrast can be generated.</p>
          <p><strong><a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/ryan-halter/">Ryan Halter</a></strong></p>
          <p>A Dartmouth engineering PhD with expertise in biomedical mechanics and electrical measurement, Professor Halter directs the senior engineering design program in engineering sciences at Dartmouth. He leads a large research effort in electrical impedance for cancer diagnostics and imaging tools to advance surgical guidance and experimental research <em>in vivo</em>.</p>
          <p><strong><a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/shudong-jiang/">Shudong Jiang</a></strong></p>
          <p>Classically trained in optoelectronics at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Professor Jiang has been at Dartmouth since 2000. She directs a research program on near infrared tomography and spectroscopy of breast cancer&mdash;an international multicenter effort. The projects have led to 3 distinct systems for breast cancer imaging, and NIH-funded clinical trials in the US and China.</p>
          <p><strong><a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/geoffrey-luke/">Geoffrey Luke</a></strong></p>
          <p>Trained in ultrasound, photoacoustic imaging, and nanotechnology, Professor Luke&rsquo;s work focuses on molecular imaging and therapeutic targeting of cancer. &nbsp;By combining newly developed imaging algorithms with nano-scale physics and targeting of biomolecules, he aims to illuminate the tumor microenvironment with super-resolution imaging and enable remotely triggerable nanotherapeutics for image-guided drug delivery.</p>
          <p><a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/keith-paulsen/"><strong>Keith Paulsen</strong></a></p>
          <p>A Dartmouth engineering PhD graduate with decades of experience in advanced computational methods in medicine, surgical guidance, breast cancer, and cancer imaging, Professor Paulsen has led multiple programs at Dartmouth including an NCI-funded project and installation of the Advanced Imaging Center and the Center for Surgical Innovation. His NIH-funded research leads efforts in surgical guidance and advanced algorithms development.</p>
          <p><strong><a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/brian-pogue/">Brian Pogue</a></strong></p>
          <p>Trained in medical physics with expertise in optical systems, spectroscopy and imaging, Professor Pogue has lead multiple doctoral education programs at Dartmouth for the last decade and initiated research and entrepreneurship in the area of radiation therapy imaging with optical signals. He currently leads several NIH-funded efforts in molecular imaging for surgery and radiation therapy guidance.</p>
          <p><strong></strong></p>
          <p><strong><a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/kimberley-samkoe/">Kimberley Samkoe</a></strong></p>
          <p>Trained in biophysical chemistry and an expert in photodynamic therapy mechanisms, Professor Samkoe has demonstrated key advances in image-guidance interpretation of therapy effects, and photodynamically activated tissue damage. The concepts of how to do quantitative molecular receptor imaging has been uniquely pioneered in her laboratory in the Department of Surgery at Geisel.</p>
          <p><strong><a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/stuart-trembly">B. Stuart Trembly</a></strong></p>
          <p>A Thayer PhD graduate, Professor Trembly has pioneered educational and research efforts in biomedical engineering at Dartmouth for decades, spinning of research into several start up companies, and developing therapeutic heating and sensing strategies for a range of diseased tissues and applications. &nbsp;His work at the edge of entrepreneurial development and innovative electromagnetic devices has led the translational medicine devices field at Dartmouth.&nbsp;</p>
