He has been involved in clinical trial work in the US as well as the UK, and maintains the nirfast.org project as an open source set of software tools.</p><p><strong><a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/ryan-halter/">Ryan Halter</a></strong></p><p>A Dartmouth engineering PhD with expertise in biomedical mechanics and electrical measurement, Professor Halter directs the senior engineering design program in engineering sciences at Dartmouth. He leads a large research effort in electrical impedance for cancer diagnostics and imaging tools to advance surgical guidance and experimental research <em>in vivo</em>.</p><p><strong><a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/p-jack-hoopes/">Jack Hoopes</a></strong></p><p>Director of the Surgical Research Laboratories at Geisel, as well as Director of the Center for Comparative Medicine at Dartmouth, Professor Hoopes has pioneered methods in experimental therapeutics, including cancer nanotechnology, hyperthermia and animal model interpretation. He is linked to most major efforts in experimental therapeutics at Dartmouth, and consults widely on aspects of veterinary pathology and animal use in research.</p><p><strong><a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/shudong-jiang/">Shudong Jiang</a></strong></p><p>Classically trained in optoelectronics at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Professor Jiang has been at Dartmouth since 2000. She directs a research program on near infrared tomography and spectroscopy of breast cancer&mdash;an international multicenter effort. The projects have led to 3 distinct systems for breast cancer imaging, and NIH-funded clinical trials in the US and China.</p><p><strong><a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/venkataramanan-krishnaswamy/">Venkat Krishnaswamy</a></strong></p><p>Trained at the Optical Science and Engineering program at University of Alabama Huntsville, Professor Krishnaswamy became an expert in optical system design for polarization and scatter sensing. At Dartmouth since 2007, he directs multiple projects involving customized cameras and software for surgical guidance imaging and tissue characterization. He is also VP of Technology at DoseOptics LLC, developing a unique optical system to visualize and quantify radiation therapy dose delivery to patients.</p><p><strong><a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/geoffrey-luke/">Geoffrey Luke</a></strong></p><p>Trained in ultrasound, photoacoustic imaging, and nanotechnology, Professor Luke&rsquo;s work focuses on molecular imaging and therapeutic targeting of cancer. &nbsp;By combining newly developed imaging algorithms with nano-scale physics and targeting of biomolecules, he aims to illuminate the tumor microenvironment with super-resolution imaging and enable remotely triggerable nanotherapeutics for image-guided drug delivery.</p><p><a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/keith-paulsen/"><strong>Keith Paulsen</strong></a></p><p>A Dartmouth engineering PhD graduate with decades of experience in advanced computational methods in medicine, surgical guidance, breast cancer, and cancer imaging, Professor Paulsen has led multiple programs at Dartmouth including an NCI-funded project and installation of the Advanced Imaging Center and the Center for Surgical Innovation. His NIH-funded research leads efforts in surgical guidance and advanced algorithms development.</p><p><strong><a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/brian-pogue/">Brian Pogue</a></strong></p><p>Trained in medical physics with expertise in optical systems, spectroscopy and imaging, Professor Pogue has lead multiple doctoral education programs at Dartmouth for the last decade and initiated research and entrepreneurship in the area of radiation therapy imaging with optical signals. He currently leads several NIH-funded efforts in molecular imaging for surgery and radiation therapy guidance.</p><p><strong><a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/kimberley-samkoe/">Kimberly Samkoe</a></strong></p><p>Trained in biophysical chemistry and an expert in photodynamic therapy mechanisms, Professor Samkoe has demonstrated key advances in image-guidance interpretation of therapy effects, and photodynamically activated tissue damage. The concepts of how to do quantitative molecular receptor imaging has been uniquely pioneered in her laboratory in the Department of Surgery at Geisel.</p><h3>Medical Advisory Committee</h3><p data-new-link="true"><strong><a href="https://www.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/findaprovider.html#/provider/41">David Roberts, MD</a></strong><br />Chair of Neurosurgery at Dartmouth-Hitchcock</p><p data-new-link="true"><strong><a href="https://www.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/findaprovider.html#/provider/248">Wendy Wells, MD</a></strong><br />Chair of the Department of Pathology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock</p><p data-new-link="true"><strong><a href="http://www.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/findaprovider.html#/provider/214">Richard Barth, MD</a></strong><br />Chief of General Surgery at Dartmouth-Hitchcock</p><p data-new-link="true"><strong><a href="http://www.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/findaprovider.html#/provider/195">Peter Kaufman, MD</a></strong><br />Hematology/Oncology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock</p><p data-new-link="true"><strong><a href="https://www.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/findaprovider.html#/provider/378">Michael Chapman, MD</a></strong><br />Chair of Dermatology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock</p><p data-new-link="true"><strong><a href="http://www.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/findaprovider.html#/provider/971">Lesley Jarvis, MD PhD</a></strong><br />Radiation Oncology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock</p><p><a href="https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/faculty/facultydb/view.php?uid=2280"><strong>Aaron Kaplan, MD</strong></a><br />Cardiology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock</p></div>
